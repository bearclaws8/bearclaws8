- 👋 Hi, I’m @bearclaws8;
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly mechanical things but expanding into learning and contributing to open source projects, advocating for borader use of open source and Linux hardware/software, building projects (usually non-software), and experimenting;
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... all the time! Trying to learn Python, begrudgingly re-learning C++ (why is it so horrible?!);
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source software, especially for hardware I have. Focusing on PineTime, LibreElec/Kodi, and RetroPie;
- 📫 How to reach me: via github is best for now;
